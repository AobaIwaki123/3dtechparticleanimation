# Portfolio Site Expansion Ideas

To further enhance your portfolio and make it stand out, here are several expansion ideas:

## 1. Interactive Experience
- **Particle Text Scrollytelling**: As the user scrolls, have the particles form different icons or words that correlate with the content (e.g., forming a Kubernetes logo when talking about DevOps).
- **Physics-based Projects**: Make the project tiles respond to the particles. Maybe particles "hit" the tiles and make them jitter slightly.

## 2. Technical Depth
- **Live Status Badges**: Integration with GitHub Actions or a status page API to show real-time build/deployment status of your projects.
- **Micro-blog/TIL Section**: A small section powered by a separate YAML or Markdown folder for "Today I Learned" snippets, showing your continuous learning process.

## 3. Design & UI
- **Custom Cursor**: A particle-based custom cursor that leaves a trail as it moves across the portfolio.
- **Glassmorphism Enhancements**: Add more depth to the project tiles with subtle shadows and varying transparency based on scroll position.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Change the gradient or particle color theme based on the time of day or the project being viewed.

## 4. Content & Reach
- **Activity Heatmap**: Embed your GitHub contribution heatmap directly in the Hero or a dedicated "Impact" section.
- **Testimonials/Recommendations**: If you have feedback from colleagues or open-source contributors, add a subtle carousel for these.
- **RSS Feed Integration**: If you write on Zenn, pull in your latest articles dynamically.

## 5. Performance & DX
- **PWA Support**: Make the portfolio installable for offline viewing.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Easy toggle between Japanese and English, as the current description is in Japanese while the UI is largely English.
